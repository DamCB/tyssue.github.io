Time is a long overdue for the first tyssue community meeting.

This website (and repo) are here to setup, organize and record this meeting. Due to current situation, the meeting will take place online only, which also helps reducing greatly its cost. I hope this can be a way to strengthen the library and start ensuring its future.

# Program


Maybe four three-hour long slots are sufficient (more time on a virtual gathering is too much IMHO).

What I feel should happen (feel free to chime in):

## First half-day

1. One keynote talk (I hope I can convince Magali Suzanne to do that).

2. Talks for anyone who wants to share its work / projects with tyssue.

## Second half-day

Open community discussion.

## Third half-day

Workshop and tutorial(s).

## Fourth half-day

Hackathon
